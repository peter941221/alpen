//! Chunk builder — creates chunks from batch builder events.
//!
//! Chunking is a prover optimization: breaking batches into smaller
//! provable units. The chunk builder consumes [`BatchBuilderEvent`]s
//! from the batch builder via the service framework's message loop
//! and creates chunks according to a configurable sealing policy,
//! with batch boundaries as a hard constraint (chunks must not cross
//! batch boundaries).
//!
//! The chunk builder receives a validated, reorg-safe, ordered stream
//! of events from the batch builder rather than watching the block
//! stream directly. This guarantees it never runs ahead of the batch
//! builder and inherits reorg handling for free.
//!
//! # Startup sequence
//!
//! 1. [`cleanup_orphaned_chunks`] — revert chunks past the last complete batch boundary. Chunks
//!    from incomplete batches are discarded because the sealing policy cannot guarantee the same
//!    block range after restart.
//! 2. [`repair_batch_linkage`] — if the latest chunk's batch exists but was never linked (crash
//!    after sealing all chunks but before the boundary was processed), reconstruct the linkage from
//!    chunk `batch_idx` fields.
//! 3. [`init_chunk_builder_state`] — load state from storage. After steps 1–2 the latest chunk's
//!    batch is always linked.
//! 4. Service launch — backfill of unchunked batches runs in `on_launch` via
//!    [`recovery::enqueue_backfill`].
