//! Background chunk-witness extraction task.
//!
//! Owns the chunk-witness pipeline that previously ran inline in the
//! batch builder's `seal_batch`. The batch builder now publishes a
//! [`ChunkExtractRequest`] on an mpsc channel and continues; this task
//! drains the channel, runs the (CPU-heavy) extractor in
//! `spawn_blocking`, retries on transient failures, and persists the
//! result via [`ChunkWitnessStore`].
//!
//! Why a separate task:
//! - **No race against `AccessedStateGenerator`.** The exex and the batch builder both react to
//!   canonical-chain events; the builder can seal a chunk for blocks the exex hasn't persisted yet.
//!   Retrying inline would block the builder loop. Here, the retry happens off the hot path —
//!   nobody upstream cares how long the exex takes to catch up.
//! - **No blocking the builder pipeline.** `seal_batch` is a channel `send`. Extraction work, RLP
//!   encoding, and sled writes all happen on this task's executor.
//!
//! Failure model: the only realistic transient cause of extractor
//! failure is the upstream exex lag (see analysis on PR #1822). Other
//! errors (reth state pruned, multiproof inconsistency, sled IO) are
//! structural and won't recover on retry. The task retries
//! unconditionally with bounded exponential backoff — non-transient
//! errors burn the retry budget and then surface as a permanent
//! `error!` log, identical to the prior inline-warn behavior but
//! without losing chunks to the millisecond race window.
